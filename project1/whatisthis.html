			<p class = "greentxt"> Have you ever watched a movie or tv show with a ridiculous
			hacking scene? The kind where the computer experts frantically tap on their keyboard and
			windows and graphs sporadically pop up. The video linked to the side is a great example.
			This website seeks to emulate these hacking tropes with the hopes of demonstrating just
			how absurd these scenes are and to raise awareness of how poorly understood the
		action of hacking is.
